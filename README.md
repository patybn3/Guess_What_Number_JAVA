/*
Create a program that asks a user to input a number
between 1 and 10 to see if it is the number the computer generates.

Give the end user at least 10 tries to guess the number.

Create a menu that allows the user to 1. get help, 2. play the game, 3. exit the game.

The program must use decision constructs
(if or switch statments) and looping constructs (while, for, or do while loops).

Extra Credit:

Create a menu that runs your Guess What Number game and has the ability to:
Get instructions as to how to play the game
Start the game again
Exit the game
